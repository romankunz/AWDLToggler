AWDLToggler: Seamless Control over Apple Wireless Direct Link Interface

Overview
AWDLToggler is a sophisticated, windowless agent designed to provide users with intuitive control over the Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL) interface directly from the macOS menu bar. This lightweight application allows users to effortlessly monitor the status of their AWDL interfaceâ€”indicating whether it is active or inactive and offers the capability to enable or disable the interface with just a click. Developed with both simplicity and efficiency in mind, AWDLToggler caters to users who require quick access to their network settings without navigating through complex system preferences.

Features
Menu Bar Icon: A discreet yet accessible icon resides in your menu bar, providing at-a-glance status updates on the AWDL interface. This icon serves as a gateway to controlling your AWDL settings, ensuring that management of your wireless connection is always just a click away.
Instant Status Updates: Easily determine whether the AWDL interface is up or down through the menu bar icon. This immediate feedback allows for swift troubleshooting and ensures that you are always aware of your connection status.
Enable/Disable AWDL Interface: With a simple toggle from the menu, users can activate or deactivate the AWDL interface. This feature is invaluable for optimizing your device's connectivity and security, allowing for a customized networking experience.
Advanced Implementation
Privileged Helper Application: AWDLToggler includes a privileged helper application designed to execute tasks that require elevated permissions. This component is crucial for enabling and disabling the AWDL interface, ensuring that changes to your device's network settings are handled securely and efficiently.
Daemon Installation: Alongside the helper application, AWDLToggler installs a daemon that continuously monitors the AWDL interface's status. This background process is designed to ensure that if the AWDL interface is activated unintentionally or without user consent, it can be automatically deactivated. This proactive monitoring safeguards against unwanted network activities and maintains the user's preferred settings.
Security and Privacy: Understanding the importance of security and privacy, AWDLToggler is engineered to operate with minimal permissions. The application and its components are designed to interact with system settings only to the extent necessary for managing the AWDL interface, ensuring that your device remains secure and your data private.
